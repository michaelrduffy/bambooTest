# bambooTest

TO START: 
Use npm install to install all dependencies

Use mongod --dbpath=data to start mongodb

Use npm start to start the server

Connect to the site at http://localhost:3000


//Note//

I ran out of time to implement the 'view transaction history' feature but the rest is all there, even with the minimal styling.
